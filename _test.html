<p>&lt;h2&gt;End Housing Alienation Now!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing in c\\a\\n\\a\\d\\a is characterized by
  unaffordability, disrepair, under-housing, precarity, and homelessness. This is housing alienation—the condition of
  being separated from our fundamental connections to home. It separates us from the land we inhabit, the social world
  that supports us, and our full creative lives. We are Architects Against Housing Alienation and we believe the current
  housing system in c\\a\\n\\a\\d\\a must be abolished!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation of land and homes into
  profit-generating commodities has caused alienation. This condition began with colonial land dispossession. When
  European settlers arrived in c\\a\\n\\a\\d\\a, they began a process that not only violently took land away from
  Indigenous peoples, but also attacked Indigenous ways of knowing and doing. Through this encounter, land became
  conceptualized as private property, reserved for the exclusive use of its owner and yet easily exchanged, throwing
  something as rooted as land into circulation. We use Simoogit Saa Bax Patrick Stewart’s backslashes in
  c\\a\\n\\a\\d\\a to refer to these originating land divisions and separations. c\\a\\n\\a\\d\\a is divided by property
  lines and separated by the drive for profit over the connection to place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, homes are designed
  to be exchangeable assets. They follow the rules of real estate speculation so that they can store wealth and be
  easily traded for profit, resulting in environments that are racist, sexist, and classist. Housing alienation
  disproportionately robs the working class, women, and racialized people of their power to determine for themselves the
  means of their survival and flourishing. Profit-driven housing production depends on exploitative labour practices and
  the degradation of the environment through unsustainable construction and resource extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We
  seek to end housing alienation by rebuilding connections to land, to community, and to creative self-determination. As
  activists, advocates, and architects, we are working collaboratively to create the political will, economic and policy
  frameworks, and designs for housing that are socially, ecologically, and creatively empowering for
  all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;To end housing alienation in c\\a\\n\\a\\d\\a, we demand:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
  href=&quot;/en/demand/land-back&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Land Back:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We demand that all land
  c\\a\\n\\a\\d\\a claims for the “crown” be returned to First Nations, Métis, and Inuit Peoples as Indigenous
  land.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/demand/land-housing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Land
  Housing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We demand on-the-land, off-grid, nomadic communities for Indigenous women and girls
  with access to safe, secure, affordable, culturally relevant wrap around support services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
  href=&quot;/en/demand/home-building-lodges&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Nations Home Building
  Lodges:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We demand Home Building Design Lodges tied to housing manufacturing facilities on
  reserves, to build capacity within communities by grounding the production of houses and their components, in
  community values, language, and education.​&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
  href=&quot;/en/demand/reparative-architecture&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reparative Architecture:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  We demand reparative architecture for the Black residents who have been displaced or are at the risk of being
  displaced due to state-led gentrification. We demand the state provide reparations by funding Black-led community land
  trusts for the creation of affordable housing and commercial space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
  href=&quot;/en/demand/gentrification-tax&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Gentrification Tax:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We
  demand a Gentrification Tax to capture the unearned increment of value to build and secure deeply affordable housing
  within a community land trust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
  href=&quot;/en/demand/surplus-properties-housing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surplus Properties for
  Housing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We demand that all levels of government make available surplus public property
  assets for the development of affordable housing and the public good that is not for sale—not now and not in the
  future!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
  href=&quot;/en/demand/intentional-communities-unhoused-people&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intentional Communities for
  Unhoused People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Across Canada, there is a rapidly expanding gap between “living rough” on
  the street or in self-made encampments, and gaining access to long-term housing. To support unhoused people, cities
  must use underutilized land to fund and build intentional communities where residents receive services, share
  community responsibilities, and regain agency to govern space and their lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
  href=&quot;/en/demand/collective-ownership&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collective Ownership:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We
  demand that municipalities incorporate guidelines that prioritize co-living, cooperative and co-housing over
  speculative real estate development and that credit unions and banks remove roadblocks and create pathways to
  cooperative financing models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
  href=&quot;/en/demand/mutual-aid-housing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutual Aid Housing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We demand
  housing for mutual aid in the urban core, where density and supportive programming respond to existing needs, foster
  community-building, and provide culturally-appropriate support to refugees. Large-scale development will foster
  cooperative support among people of diverse backgrounds and experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
  href=&quot;/en/demand/ambient-ecosystems-commons&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambient Ecosystem
  Commons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We demand a vision and participatory process for housing development that upholds
  ambient urban ecosystems as a continuously accessible commons necessary for social housing. This process must lead to
  concrete action to improve the ambient commons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a

  &lt;em&gt;The Atlas of Housing Alienation&lt;/em&gt;, a collaboration with film producer and editor Marie-Espérance
  Cerda, is an original documentary film that introduces viewers to the history of housing alienation in
  c\\a\\n\\a\\d\\a. In the short film, historical film footage is clipped and organized into a series of thematic
  chapters that place a critical lens on the history of land, colonization, capitalism, and housing in the place now
  known as c\\a\\n\\a\\d\\a. It begins by evoking the pre-contact days of Turtle Island’s stewardship by Indigenous
  peoples, then explores the construction of new notions of property ownership resulting from European settler and
  Indigenous people’s contact through later eras of westward settler colonial “progress,” industrialization, and
  inequalities around race and gender experienced in connection to housing, as well as current conditions of
  financialization and houselessness. To counterbalance the sometimes deeply propagandistic source material—selling the
  Canadian frontier to white settlers—the film uses montage, narration, and a chapter structure that complicates the
  received story of the nation state to raise important questions and expose the complexity of this history.&lt;/p&gt;
