<p>&lt;p&gt;For Indigenous people home is land. Home is not the walls of a physical house, but people’s physical,
  cultural, emotional and spiritual relationships with the land. These relationships that form one’s home, are found on
  the land. All land in c\a\n\a\d\a is Indigenous land, so this capitalist nation-state is built on stolen land. This
  theft was initiated in by Europeans through both abstract decrees like the Doctrine of Discovery and Royal
  proclamations, and individual settlers&#039; physical acts of homesteading. This process was structured through
  legislation in the nineteenth century, most importantly the Indian Act, which left Indigenous people legally,
  culturally, ecologically, and existentially landless and homeless. This process of land dispossession enriched
  settlers, creating their intergenerational wealth, while enacting an Indigenous genocide. Yet, the theft of Indigenous
  land has not only alienated Indigenous people, but settlers as well. All beings in this territory are alienated from
  the land, because healthy and empowering housing cannot be built on stolen land. The most important step addressing
  the deplorable housing conditions produced by these land policies is the return of land to Indigenous
  people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demand that all public lands claimed by the “crown” and controlled by all levels of
  government–municipal, provincial and federal–be governed jointly by the Indigenous Nations (First Nations, Inuit and
  Metis) in whose territory the land resides and the government of c\a\n\a\d\a as a “co-ownership trust.” This
  arrangement would benefit Indigenous Peoples, settlers and immigrants, by allowing access for Indigenous people to the
  land, privileging sustainable relations with non-human natural world, and making better use of the precious resources
  of the land. This would be a radical departure from existing processes of consultation, which are non-binding and
  allocate Indigenous Nations little or nothing of the substantial revenues that private companies reap from extraction
  on their territories, obstruct First People&#039;s use of these lands, and devastate their fragile
  ecologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples of what this might look like are starting to appear—such as with a “nature
  agreement” between British Columbia’s First Nations and the provincial and federal governments to formally preserve
  and protect land, species, and biodiversity in the province through Indigenous leadership. Another example is the
  creation of a community land trust to preserve an eco-cultural landscape on a small island, SISȻENEM, in British
  Columbia. Both show how land back can be achieved through forms of co-management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Land Back calls
  for a complete rethinking of both land relations and the housing system in c\a\n\a\d\a. Only a true restoration of
  Indigenous land values, creating what the Nisga&#039;a call the common bowl–to which everyone contributes and from
  which everyone can be fed–can create a real home for all people. This requires educating everyone about the violence
  of colonialism and its land dispossession, its destruction of non-commodified understandings of home, and the power of
  a non-acquisitive and cooperative relationship to land as a foundation for equitable housing system. As a pilot
  project, we have created many maps of territory as a means to this end, helping everyone to envision with two-eyed
  seeing (indigenous lens with one eye and the other eye, a western lens) what such a transformation at the scale of
  territory could look like.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
